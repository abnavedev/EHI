Although the term ‘empire’ is often used in these cases, these modern empires were different from pre-modern ones. Whereas the relationship between the core region and the periphery in pre-modern empires was based on taxes and tributes, in the modern empires the relationship was capitalistic, that is, based on an imperative to protect business interests.  The colonies were diverse entities. The diversity owed to local conditions as well as to the history of colonization. British India started in the mid-eighteenth century from the intrigues of the English East India Company negotiating trade licenses with the ruler of Bengal. By contrast, much of interior Africa was colonized by the European states late in the nineteenth century, even though European slave traders had long been familiar with the African littoral. Colonies were governed differently too. British India was ruled by Britain directly, whereas in Africa, governance was often delegated to local chiefs and private companies. The length and directness of rule, and the legacy of Mughal bureaucratic culture that the British inherited, saw more political continuity and stability in India. In Africa, there was greater rupture between the traditional and the modern states, unleashing much violence.  Where did modern empires spring from? One theory attributes it to mature capitalism. In one definition, mature capitalism meant too much capital chasing too few profitable investments at home; in another, it meant unsold goods seeking markets; and in a third, it meant the authority of monopoly firms who had the capacity to sponsor colonization. The English economist J.A. Hobson stressed the investment motive for territorial expansion. The Austrian-born German Marxist intellectual Rudolf Hilferding believed that imperialism was funded by bankers. The Polish–German activist and writer Rosa Luxemburg stressed the consumption motive. The American sociologist James O’Connor and the British economist Tom Kemp discussed the role of politically connected multinationals.  Did colonialism derive from the profit motive? Evidence of an association between profitability and colonization is weak. Capital export from the West to the non-West was small in extent outside of railways and government bonds. Expansion was often driven by a desire to access particular natural resources. While there were instances (like Congo under the Belgian king Leopold II) where such resources were extracted with force, there were also colonies that exported little of value, consumed little European goods, and had few European businesses, the French Saharan territories for example. Even when the gains were large in absolute terms, questions remain on whether relative rates of return from colonial investment were higher than alternative uses of capital, and how far the gains explained Europe’s accumulation and growth.  The difficulty of explaining colonialism with profitability leads to other theories. Some of these explanations, developed with reference to the British Empire, stress global political rivalries ( J. Gallagher and R. Robinson), or the interests of the financial interests of London, the gentlemanly capitalists who were keen to maintain a worldwide flow of funds (P. Cain and A.G. Hopkins).

Based on an interpretation of Hinduism, the German sociologist Max Weber saw Indian culture to be anti-entrepreneurial. By removing these endogenous obstacles to capitalism colonial rule and globalization had a beneficial or ‘modernizing’ effect upon India.  Since then, scholars have shown that the hierarchy and diversity, which these writers thought were intrinsic to Indian society, were in fact quite fluid, and did not impinge on enterprise in quite so negative a way. Business relations did not necessarily form out of social ties, but often out of shared professional interests. The flourishing early modern trade from India showed how caste and community could be a positive resource for business, by making it possible for merchants, bankers, and artisans to share risk or information.  And yet, it would be rash to dismiss the negative assessment of caste and community. One recent literature, associated with the work of Avner Greif, draws attention to the principle on which cooperative communities formed. Greif suggests that ‘interest-based, self-governed, non-kin-based organizations’  played a major role in the modernization of Europe. This literature does not use India. But if this theory is correct, then India, where professional groups usually developed around kinship and marriage, should show how societies fail to generate endogenous growth. If we look closely at Indian history, there is evidence that caste and community did not pose an insurmountable barrier to innovative behaviour; but there is also support for the view that caste and community could pose barriers to exchange of information between professionals who would gain by collaborating. While not restraining growth, such barriers slowed down technological change.  Within economic theory, there is a renewed emphasis on group identity. One strand suggests that caste-like groups, which make conformity to norm a positive moral value and any breach of norm a sin, can suppress individual enterprise. Another strand makes the case that ethnic diversity tends to weaken the impetus to spend on public goods, such as education. In one model, developed in the context of a democratic setup, this outcome follows from assuming that the utility derived by one group from public goods depends negatively upon the utility that others derive. Indian history, which supplies examples of both conformity and low expenditure on public goods, deserves to be investigated in the light of these ideas.
